GAME MODES:
- Default
- This is the normal version of the game Concentration
- The winner of the game is the person who collects the most sets of cards
- A player collects a set of cards by finding a pair on the board
- On each turn a player gets to flip over two cards
- If the two cards are identical, then the cards are removed from the board
  and the current player gains a set
- If the two cards are not identical, then the cards are flipped back over, the
  current player does not gain a set, and the turn is passed to the next player
- One Flip
- This game mode is the same as the default game mode, however the difference
  is
  that each player gets to only flip one card during their turn.
- If the card they flip creates a pair, they collect the set and play again
- Quick Switch:
- This game mode is the same as the default game mode, however the difference
  is
  that each time a player gains a set, they do not get to play again, instead they pass
  their turn to the next player
		  
PLAYER RESTRICTIONS:
	- All of the game modes can be played with 2- 6 players
