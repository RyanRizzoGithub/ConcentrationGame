		- On each turn a player gets to flip over two cards\
		- If the two cards are identical, then the cards are removed from the board\
		  and the current player gains a set\
		- If the two cards are not identical, then the cards are flipped back over, the\
		  current player does not gain a set, and the turn is passed to the next player\
\
